💹 Wipro Stock Price Analysis (Power BI)

📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Collaborative Academic Group Study focusing on the financial performance of major Indian IT corporations. While the group analyzed multiple companies, **my individual contribution was the complete analysis of Wipro. 

I led the data modeling, DAX-based risk-return assessment, and the design of the Wipro-specific visual dashboard.

🎯 Project Objectives
- Stock Trend Mapping: Analyzing historical price movements for Wipro across 2023 (Q1, Q2, and Q3).
- Risk & Return Metrics: Evaluating monthly fluctuations to assist in data-driven investment decisions.
- Comparative Quarterly Analysis: Breaking down performance trends to identify seasonal growth or declines.

📊 Key Insights from Wipro Analysis
Based on the dashboard visuals:
- Price Performance: Wipro maintained a strong price range between 4.5 and 4.9. 
- Recovery Trend: After a slight dip in April (4.5), the stock showed a consistent "Waterfall" recovery, peaking back at 4.9 in July.
- Quarterly Weight: July and February represent the highest valuation months, accounting for over 34% of the total price weight in the analyzed period.

🛠 Technical Implementation
- Advanced Visualizations: Utilized Waterfall Charts to show cumulative value changes and Clustered Column/Bar charts for monthly comparisons.
- Interactive Slicers: Implemented a month-based navigation bar (February - July) to allow for granular data drilling.
- Data Modeling: Structured time-series data to ensure accurate quarterly reporting and financial accuracy.
